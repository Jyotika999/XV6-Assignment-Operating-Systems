# XV6-SYSTEM-CALL

This is all about the Assignment Of Operating System for XV6.

**What is XV6?**   
* Xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
  Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
  but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.
* Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006 for MIT's operating systems course, 6.828: Operating System Engineering. We hope that xv6 will be useful in other courses too. This page collects resources to aid the use of xv6 in other courses, including a commentary on the source code itself.


**Tasks**
* Task1 : Tracing a System Call using XV6
* Task2 : Adding a System Call in XV6
